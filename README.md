# SKI HOP

This game was created as a mini-project by msardina.
Ski hop is a fun simple game about a little cute bunny going down a fun mountain in Niseko (Japan).
Have fun and enjoy! :D

## Story

Tsuki the rabbit was found by some hikers in a forest. He got taken away from his family and with the hikers as a pet. At first, Tsuki has no idea what to do. Until he found some skiis the hikers had left at the camp site. He took them and began to ski away.
Tsuki is not very good at skiing so YOU have to help him get down the mountain and back to the forest. Good luck!
